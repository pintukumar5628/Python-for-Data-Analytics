    "Abstraction focuses on hiding unnecessary details while exposing only the relevant features of an object. It's about creating a simplified representation of an object's behavior and characteristics. Abstraction is achieved by defining abstract classes and interfaces with abstract methods that must be implemented by concrete subclasses. The goal is to create a clear separation between the high-level functionality and the implementation details.\n",

It restricts direct access to the internal data of an object and enforces access through methods, providing control over how data is modified and accessed. Encapsulation helps in data hiding and prevents unintended interference or modification of the object's state.\n",

    "Ans:-The abc module in Python stands for \"Abstract Base Classes.\" It provides a way to work with abstract classes and interfaces, which are classes that cannot be instantiated directly and serve as blueprints for other classes to inherit from. Abstract base classes are used to define a common structure and a set of required methods that subclasses must implement.\n",

It allows you to define abstract methods in abstract base classes, which must be implemented by the concrete subclasses. This helps in creating consistent and well-defined APIs across different subclasses.\n",
